# Padholikho.com — Project Summary & Documentation

**Repository path:** `02_Basic_Security_Measures/`  
**Filename:** `Padholikho.com.md`

## 1. Overview

Padholikho.com is a custom EdTech demo site hosted inside the FireNetX virtual lab. It is a deliberately simple web application used for learning, testing, and demonstrating security hardening, web-server configuration, and common web vulnerabilities in a controlled environment.

---

## 2. Purpose & Goals

- Provide a realistic target for web-focused labs (Pentesting, scanning, web app security)
- Demonstrate web deployment steps on an Ubuntu server (Apache)
- Validate HTTPS configuration, redirect rules, and web hardening practices
- Serve as a playground for students to learn login flows, session handling, and basic authentication
- Keep production-sensitive data out — this is a lab/demo only
