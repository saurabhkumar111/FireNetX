# 🛡️ Types of Network Threats

Network threats are malicious activities that target computer networks, systems, or data.  
Their goal is often to steal information, disrupt operations, or gain unauthorized access.  
Below are the most common types of network threats explained in simple terms.

---

## 1. **Viruses**
A **virus** is a malicious program that attaches itself to legitimate files or applications and spreads when the infected file is executed.  
It can corrupt data, delete files, slow down systems, or even make them unusable.  
**Example:** The *ILOVEYOU* virus (2000) spread through email and caused billions in damages.

## 2. **Worms**
A **worm** is a self-replicating malware that spreads automatically across networks without user action.  
It exploits system or network vulnerabilities, consuming bandwidth and slowing down operations.  
**Example:** The *Conficker* worm infected millions of computers globally.

## 3. **Trojans (Trojan Horses)**
A **Trojan** disguises itself as a legitimate program but secretly performs malicious tasks.  
It often installs backdoors, allowing attackers to take control of a victim’s system.  
**Example:** The *Zeus Trojan* stole banking information from millions of users.

---

## 4. **Phishing Attacks**
**Phishing** tricks users into sharing personal details such as passwords or credit card numbers.  
Attackers send fake emails or create fraudulent websites that look like trusted services.  
**Example:** Emails posing as banks asking users to “verify” their account details.

## 5. **Denial-of-Service (DoS) Attacks**
A **DoS attack** floods a network or server with massive amounts of fake traffic, making it unavailable to real users.  
A **DDoS attack** uses multiple compromised systems to amplify the effect.  
**Example:** The *GitHub DDoS attack (2018)* disrupted one of the world’s largest code-hosting platforms.

---

## 6. **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks**
In a **MitM attack**, a hacker intercepts communication between two parties to eavesdrop or alter data in transit.  
This often happens on unsecured Wi-Fi networks.  
**Example:** Stealing login credentials during an online banking session.

---

## 7. **Ransomware**
**Ransomware** encrypts files on a victim’s device and demands payment (ransom) to restore access.  
It spreads through infected attachments, malicious downloads, or network vulnerabilities.  
**Example:** *WannaCry (2017)* exploited a Windows flaw and infected hundreds of thousands of systems.

---

## 8. **Insider Threats**
An **insider threat** comes from employees or trusted individuals who misuse access, either intentionally or accidentally.  
It can involve leaking sensitive data, sabotaging systems, or ignoring security policies.  
**Example:** An employee sharing confidential client data with outsiders.

---

## 9. **Zero-Day Exploits**
A **Zero-Day exploit** targets previously unknown software vulnerabilities before the vendor can patch them.  
These attacks are extremely dangerous because they have no immediate defense.  
**Example:** Zero-day exploits found in Windows or Chrome before official fixes were released.
