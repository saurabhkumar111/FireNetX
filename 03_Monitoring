# 📡 Network Traffic Monitoring and Analysis — FireNetX

## 🎯 Objective
To monitor and analyze network traffic on the FireNetX network using **Wireshark**, identifying different types of packets (HTTP, HTTPS, DNS, ARP, etc.) and understanding their role in secure and insecure communication.

---

## 🌿 Steps Performed

### 1. Start Wireshark Capture
Wireshark was launched on the Kali system to capture live packets on the **“eth0”** interface.

```apache
sudo wireshark &
```

2. Capture Network Traffic

Normal browsing activities and requests to https://192.168.56.102 (FireNetX portal) were generated while capture was active.

Captured protocols included:

DNS: for domain resolution

ARP: for local IP-to-MAC mapping

HTTP/HTTPS: for web traffic

TCP/UDP: transport layer communication
